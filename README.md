## The Problem
Mathematics is the language of the universe, but for many, it remains a wall of text. Concepts like **Monodromy**—how mathematical objects change as you move around a singularity—are often buried in dry textbooks.

* **Too Abstract:** Hard to visualize in the mind's eye.
* **Too Static:** Formulas on paper don't "move."
* **High Barrier:** Usually reserved for advanced topology students.

## The Solution
I built a reactive, educational engine that turns complex analysis into a neon-soaked puzzle game.

* **Interactive Controls:** Drag squares (coefficients) to drive the dots (roots).
* **Real-time Visualization:** See the "dance" of roots on the complex plane instantly.
* **Gamified Learning:** Guide the roots to specific targets to understand the underlying group theory structure.

## Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 Pro
This project was built using a **symbiotic workflow** with Gemini 3 Pro in Google AI Studio.

* **The Architect & The Designer:** I delegated the heavy lifting—framing the code architecture and complex visualization logic—to the AI.
* **"Dev Mode" for Precision:** To ensure a perfect learning curve, I asked Gemini to build a **Level Designer** (toggleable with 'D'). This allowed me to manually fine-tune parameters in real-time.
* **Speed:** What would have taken months of learning React and WebGL took only 4 days of conversation with Gemini.


## Tech Stack
* **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript
* **Rendering:** [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
* **AI Model:** Gemini 3 Pro (Preview)
